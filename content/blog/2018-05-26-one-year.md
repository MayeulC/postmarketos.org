In February 2017 Jeremy McNicoll did a presentation on his progress on [forward porting Google Nexus 5X/6P](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=77tuFtM4gjA). He explains the technical difficulties of replacing the downstream Linux kernel that you find on your device after you bought it with the latest [upstream version](https://www.kernel.org/). Towards the end, he comments his "lessons learned" slide with the words: "Maybe 10 years ago I would have said we can cure world hunger, we can get the whole thing working." Then he shaked his head. "I'm more realistic now."

This is how it felt like one and a half years ago. It was hard to imagine that we could have phones that would run the upstream kernel. Which means that every time the vendor's ridiculously short support cycle ends, we would not have a feasible method of patching all the critical security holes in the core of the operating system.

Don't get your hopes up too high, there is still a long way to go. But after all the amazing work done by hackers in communities like ##linux-msm and #freedreno, this is getting realistic now. Besides the progress in postmarketOS, this goal is being adapted by more projects. Two more distributions decided to make mainline Linux on (specific) phones their mission: [Pure OS](https://puri.sm/shop/librem-5/) and [Maemo Leste](https://maemo-leste.github.io/).

Even established vendors seem to be moving in this direction. In March of this year, the [Linaro Connect Opening Keynote](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lMh4ZmR59hQ) had 15 minutes of convincing its big list of [member companies](https://www.linaro.org/members/) that mainline is the way to go: "Very few embedded SoCs are supported properly upstream. That is changing, it has to change. [...] and most importantly, we have to do that upstream. Because nothing else scales. Testing just your own version doesn't actually help everyone else. And as a result you don't get the benefit of everybody else's testing."

## postmarketOS: Experimental Sustainable Operating System
Before we begin with our list of changes since the last post in [December](/blog/2017/12/31/219-days-of-postmarketOS/), here's the usual summary for people new to the project: postmarketOS aims to be a sustainable operating system that empowers users to safely use their devices until they physically break. We divide the system into packages and share them between all devices, with a few device-specific packages as exception. In contrary to having the whole system built device specific (like Android), this makes the system much more maintainable.

At this point, postmarketOS is only meant to be used by developers. In most instances, phone calls, SMS, bluetooth or the mainline kernel won't work on your device, and there's the [firmware problem](https://ollieparanoid.github.io/post/security-warning/).

## Nexus 5: FLOSS Modem Stack With Mainline

You might remember [@bshah](https://github.com/bhush9)'s  photo of the [Nexus 5](https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/Google_Nexus_5_(lg-hammerhead)) running mainline with a [flipped and distorted screen](/static/img/2017-12/mainline-hammerhead.jpg) from December. [@flto](https://github.com/flto) [continued](https://github.com/flto/linux/wiki/hammerhead-upstream) his work: the display works without problems now. Even better, the touch screen is working, it has 3D acceleration with the open source [freedreno](https://github.com/freedreno/freedreno/wiki) userspace driver, Wi-Fi works, and the best part is that [@MartijnBraam](https://github.com/MartijnBraam) was able to send SMS via command line and get a connectivity signal from the modem through [oFono](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/oFono) displayed in [Plasma Mobile](https://plasma-mobile.org/) ([#1502](https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/pull/1502)).

There is a bit more that needs to be done before we can make calls, for example the audio stack is not configured yet. But right there we can communicate with the Qualcomm Modem Interface (QMI) without using any proprietary userspace programs! This would not have been possible without the amazing work from [@scintill](https://github.com/scintill) who packaged all necessary glue libraries provided by [@andersson](https://github.com/andersson) ([#1314](https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/pull/1314)). The first pull request made it work with the downstream kernel of the [Galaxy S4 Mini LTE](https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/Samsung_Galaxy_S4_Mini_LTE) followed by another PR that enabled it to work with our mainline packaging ([#1381](https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/pull/1381)).

## 39 New Devices
* first
* second
* third

Notably four of these are running close to mainline:
 * sony-sirius
 * samsung-klte
 * linux-samsung-p4wifi
 * nokia-n9

## Improved Continuous Integration
Whenever someone got their new device port to a point where it boots, the porting guide recommends to make a pull request and upstream it (so everyone can benefit from the work that has been done and build upon it). In order to keep the reviewing efforts as low as possible, [@ollieparanoid](https://github.com/ollieparanoid) implemented the following new CI checks:

* All devices must be [documented in the wiki](https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/Devices) ([#1369](https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/pull/1369))
* All changed packages must build ([#982](https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/pull/982))

[#982](https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/pull/982) also has a new test case that instructs `pmbootstrap` to do two full installations (one of them with XFCE4, the other one with Plasma Mobile). Both installations will then run in QEMU, and the test case will connect via SSH to the VM to verify the running processes. More than once this saved us from introducing bugs by accident in the installation code.

## Initramfs: Charging and Maximum Attention
postmarketOS is able to show a nice battery loading screen while it is "turned off" and charging, because [@drebrez](https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/issues/1081) integrated [`charging-sdl`](https://github.com/postmarketOS/charging-sdl) into the [initramfs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Initial_ramdisk) ([#1081](https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/issues/1081)).

When [porting pmOS to a new device](https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/Porting_to_a_new_device), it may happen that the device doesn't do anything on first boot. The screen stays dark (or displays the OEM logo) and the USB networking does not come up. In this case we don't even know for sure if the kernel we just tested is booting at all, or if it crashed before even executing the initramfs code. But this information is crucial in order to use the right [troubleshooting techniques](https://wiki.postmarketos.org/wiki/Troubleshooting:boot). Thanks to [@MayeulC](https://github.com/MayeulC) we can install the `maximum-attention` initramfs hook now, which will flash every LED it can find, as well as running the vibration motor ([#1238](https://github.com/postmarketOS/pmbootstrap/pull/1238)). Be prepared to see your device wandering across the table!
